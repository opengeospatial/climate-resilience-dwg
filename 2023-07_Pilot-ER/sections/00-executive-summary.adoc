//Problem:
//Marge: We are experiencing unprecedented climate change and crises yet continue to underutilize our geospatial data to mitigate risks, reduce costs, and enable improved decision making.  

In recognizing the impacts of climate change and monitoring the environment to achieve Sustainable Development Goals collaborative solutions  are required. This calls for standardized data and tools. But how can we ensure an effective exchange of reliable information across disciplines without sacrificing individual users' needs? Climate services require vast volumes of data from different providers to be processed by various scientific ecosystems: Raw data needs to be transformed into analysis ready data and from there into indicators to become more useful for supporting decisions. To provide a processing infrastructure that supports collaboration, we need standards based on the principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. OGC standards are aligned with these principles allowing for the reuse of data refinement features across political boundaries, organizations, and administrative levels. 

//Vision
// Albert: Suddenly 'software reuse' is introduced. needs some rewording!
Policy instruments should include technological guidelines, for example mandate the use of international standards for data formats, metadata and machine to machine communication protocols, in order to foster interoperability and software reuse. This would strengthen international collaboration on software development, and in turn contribute to the deployment of effective, robust and scientifically credible climate resilince information systems. With increased data access and interoperability of data, processing tools and data infrastructure, it can reduce human and economic costs and ensure appropriate policies are implemented to benefit all.

The OGC Climate Resilience Pilot, as the initial phase of a series of long-term climate initiatives, aimed to transform geospatial data, technologies, and other capabilities into meaningful information for various stakeholders, including decision makers, scientists, policy makers, data providers, software developers, and service providers. The pilot demonstrated the establishment of data pipelines to convert vast amounts of raw data through various steps into decision-ready information. To get to decision ready information the data first needs to be organised from multiple sources into processing pipelines, towards analysis-ready formats. The importance of analysis-ready data and decision-ready indicators was emphasized through discussions on various aspects of GEODataCubes. The pilot explored scientific aspects of climate impact by examining case studies related to droughts, floods, and wildfires, highlighting assessment tools and the complexities of climate indices. Ultimately, this Climate Resilience Pilot serves as a valuable resource for making informed decisions to support and enhance climate action. It specifically assists the location community in developing powerful visualization and communication tools to effectively address ongoing climate threats such as heat, drought, floods, and wildfires.

//In this OGC Climate Resilience Pilot, which had been the first phase of multiple long term climate activities, the aim of the work //was  to evolve geospatial data, technologies, and other capabilities into valuable information for decision makers, scientists, //policy makers, data providers, software developers, and service providers. It had been shown how data piplines could be established //to produce decision ready information out of the massive amount of availabel raw data. It has been shown how raw data from multiple //sources can be organised into data processing pipelines to bring them in formats ready for analysis. Different aspects of //GEODataCubes are discussed to emphseise the necessesity of analysis ready data and decision ready indicators. Scicetific related //aspects of climate impact are beeing discussed through the use cases of droughts, floods and wildfires, where assessment tools and //the complexity of climate indices are layed out. This Climate Resilience Pilot shows how to make valuable, informed decisions to //support and improve climate action, especially by helping the location community develop more powerful visualization and //communication tools to accurately address ongoing climate threats such as heat, drought, floods, and wildfires.

With the target user group of non technical decission makers, the workflow from data to visulisation is beeing shown at several chapters of this report. A dadicated chaper is pointing out the options and challenges of usage on artifical intelligence to establsh a 5D meta world where the efficiency of climate action can be simulated. Reduction of disaster risks du to technical engineering constructions like dams are able to be simulated. Climate resilience is not only an aspect of shift of meteorological phenomena but also related to land degradation and loss of biodiversity. Therefor the vegetation is been pointed out and options of 3D vegetation simulation is shown and how different species are surviving under changing cliamte condictions. It could be shwon that smale scale urban planning is beeing supported by the data to visualisation application where single tree species are representing the real or simulated situation of a small scale area. The pilot is showing studies of Los Angeles. 

// key findings, lessons learnd
// In addressing this vision we began with a climate architecture and plugged in data, tools, and services to test the validity and thoroughness of the concept.
The pilot recognizes the significant challenges associated with effectively conveying information to decision-makers, which necessitates a thorough examination of communication methods. As a result, a dedicated chapter has been incorporated into the pilot's work to address this issue. This chapter emphasizes unique approaches that facilitate effective communication with non-technical individuals who frequently hold responsibility for local climate resilience action strategies. By focusing on communication, the pilot aims to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that vital information is conveyed accurately and comprehensively. The inclusion of this chapter serves as a testament to the pilot's aim to enhancing communication strategies for improved decision-making in the realm of climate resilience.

// As a first important step in this direction, participants in this pilot applied data enhancement steps, such as bias adjustments, re-gridding, and calculation of climate indicators and essential variables, which led to “Decision Ready Indicators.” The spatial data infrastructures required for this integration has been designed with interoperable building blocks following FAIR data principles. Using different climate risk and impact use cases, heterogeneous data from multiple sources has been enhanced, adjusted, refined, and quality controlled to provide Science Services data products for Climate Resilience. The OGC Climate Change Services Pilots has also illustrated the graphical exploration of the Decision Ready Climate Data. It has demonstrated a framework for the design of FAIR climate services information systems. In a nutshell, the first OGC Pilot demonstrators have illustrated the necessary tools and the visualisations to address climate actions moving towards climate resilience.
// - Comparison with historical norms: calculate the difference between historical maximum temperatures and projected maximum temperatures. This analysis can provide insights into the changes in temperature patterns over time.
Based on the generated data information, there are several areas of focus and further exploration for the scenario tests and analysis in the context of climate data processing. Here is a breakdown of the key points that should be addressed in follow-on activities:

// - Higher resolution time steps: conduct analysis using weekly and daily time steps instead of monthly time steps. While monthly time steps were initially used for prototyping workflows, analyzing data at finer resolutions can provide more detailed and accurate information. However, it should be noted that processing daily time steps will require significantly more computational resources and time.

// - Regarding drought indicator: currently implemented using data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), but need to explore other sources/datasets to understand speed, reliability, and cost of accessing input data from different sources. Testing different data sources will help determine the most efficient and cost-effective approach for accessing necessary data.

// - Lowering barriers for user access: One of the objectives is to reduce barriers for users accessing CDS/ADS data and services. Gathering feedback from users about existing gaps and challenges will help improve the pilot project and engage a broader user community.

// And finally, - Develop a well-defined universal climate resilience information system
